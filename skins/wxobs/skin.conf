# An additional weewx report page that uses php to extract archival data from #
# the weewx database and present it as a series of snapshots (currently       #
# half-hourly) averaged throughout the chosen day.                            #

# Report timing:
# see http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#customizing_gen_time
#
# Once you have this report running to your satisfaction you can add
# report_timing to control it.
# If you are not editing any variables within this file then it only needs to
# be run once a day, to generate the current timestamp for the the URL link in
# links.inc
# With that in mind the report timing can be set to once per day - @daily
#
# @daily        0 0 * * *        Every day at midnight.
#report_timing = '@daily'

        # This shouldn't need changing, but if it does then /tmp is a good
        # starting point. This will most likely be used with remote servers
        # using sqlite databases, see [Remote] below
#        include_path = '/tmp'
#        send_include = False

        #
        # You are able to select the interval between entries in the
        # Periodic Stats table. This is done by specifying the time in seconds
        # with display_interval. The default is 1800, which is a half-hour.
        #
        # For those entries displayed in the Periodic Stats table, they can be
        # either the actual measured value for the displayed time --> single
        #
        # or an averaged value, derived from the entries between it and the
        # previous displayed entry --> average
        #
        # To perform these calculations the archive_interval as configured in
        # weewx.conf is used. If your archive_interval doesn't divide exactly
        # into the value for display_interval then unpredictable results may
        # be returned.

#        display_interval = 1800
#        display_type = average # the default is measured (single)

        # Yes. You can change display_interval to be equal to your weewx.conf
        # archive_interval (in seconds) and thereby get every archive record
        # for the day.  Whether you really want to or not is another matter.
        # Like so many things, it will depend on the shape of your mouth, the
        # tilt of your head and the power of your machine.
        #
        # The report page has a footer that will tell you how long the server
        # has taken to generate the page. Take note of it and act accordingly.
        # If you have any doubt then view the log output of weewx while you
        # generate the report page. If it complains... you and it may need to
        # come to a compromise.

        # appTemp display:
        #
        # Currently appTemp is not enabled by default in weewx. weewx generates
        # appTemp but the database field is missing.  You can either add that
        # field to the database or select another field to display instead of
        # appTemp. The choice is yours.  windchill seems an appropriate
        # replacement, heatindex is another?
        # Whatever you choose to display, select it from the degrees_group ie

        # start we in Australia use, then you can set your own - in seconds.
        #
        # If you do nothing then the stock timing of 12 a.m. to 12 a.m. will be
        # shown. Nothing you do here will change weewx's timings, only this

        # uncomment it. Then adjust the displayed time in the start_label tag
        # to suit that change (it's default is 9). The following example shows
