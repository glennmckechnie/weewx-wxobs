# An additional weewx report page that uses php to extract archival data from #
# the weewx database and present it as a series of snapshots (currently       #
# half-hourly) averaged throughout the chosen day.                            #

# Report timing:
# see http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#customizing_gen_time
#
# Once you have this report running to your satisfaction you can add
# report_timing to control it.
# If you are not editing any variables within this file then it only needs to
# be run once a day, to generate the current timestamp for the the URL link in
# links.inc
# With that in mind the report timing can be set to once per day - @daily
#
# @daily        0 0 * * *        Every day at midnight.
#report_timing = '@daily'


[wxobs]
        # The following two values affect the time interval between the
        # historical results and whether a single result, or an averaged result
        # is returned.  The defaults are...
        # ext_interval = 1800 ( every half hour)
        # arch_interval = set this to be the same value as ext_interval above
        # leave it commented out and the the archive_interval - as set in
        # weewx.conf will be used.
        # They can be changed by adjusting and uncommenting the following, as
        # appropriate
        #ext_interval = 3600  # 1 hour spacing if uncommented
        #arch_interval = 3600 # then leave this commented out to get hourly
                              # readings with a single record returned, no
                              # averaging of the results.

        # appTemp display:
        #
        # Currently appTemp is not enabled by default in weewx. weewx generates
        # appTemp but the database field is missing.
        # You can either add that field to the database or select another field
        # to display instead of appTemp. The choice is yours.
        # appTemp is the default for this skin, replace that field by
        # uncommenting the following
        app_Temp = windchill
        # windchill seems an appropriate replacement, heatindex is another?

        # the database is in US units (imperial) or the units that are returned
        # don't match the native units required for the delta-T calcs
        # An information div is included in the report page when this occurs.
        #
        # The delta-T calcs will be adjusted for the most of the incoming units
        # but there may be further work required if the script doesn't detect
        # your incoming unit types. We need to make sure that the Units are
        # configured correctly in the [Units] [[Groups]] section below this.
        # This is a switch (boolean) to turn it off

        # to show.
