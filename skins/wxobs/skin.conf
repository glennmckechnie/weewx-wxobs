# Report timing:
# see http://www.weewx.com/docs/customizing.htm#customizing_gen_time
#
# Once you have this report running to your satisfaction you can add
# report_timing to control it.
# If you are not editing any variables within this file then it only needs to
# be run once a day, to generate the current timestamp for the the URL link in
# links.inc
# With that in mind the report timing can be set to once per day - @daily
#
# @daily        0 0 * * *        Every day at midnight.
#report_timing = '@daily'


[wxobs]
        # The following two values affect the time interval between the
        # historical results and whether a single result, or an averaged result
        # is returned.  The defaults are...
        # ext_interval = 1800 ( every half hour)
        # arch_interval = weewx archive_interval - as set in weewx.conf.
        # They can be changed by adjusting and uncommenting the following, as
        # appropriate
        #ext_interval = 3600  # 1 hour spacing if uncommented
        #arch_interval = 3600 # uncommenting this will force averaging of each
                              # (hourly) interval to be returned for each time
                              # interval displayed

        # appTemp display:
        #
        # Currently appTemp is not enabled by default in weewx. weewx generates
        # appTemp but the database field is missing.
        # You can either add that field to the database or select another field
        # to display instead of appTemp. The choice is yours.
        # windchill seems an appropriate replacement, heatindex is another?
        # Whatever you choose to display, select it from the degrees_group
        # ie the unit display is degF or degC
        # windchill is the default for this skin, replace that field by

        [[RainTiming]]

        # There appear to be variations on when rain records start and finish.
        # I guess our grandparents didn't see the point in getting up at midnight
        # to check the gauge for the townies.
        # weewx records from midnight to midnight - a perfectly sensible timing
        # routine for a device that never sleeps. We on the other hand do like
        # our naps and may still keep manual records.
        # This option allows for a time shift, and if you don't want the 9 a.m.
        # start we in Australia use, then you can set your own - in seconds.
        #
        # If you do nothing then the stock timing of 12 a.m. to 12 a.m. will be
        # shown. Nothing you do here will change weewx's timings, only this
        # report will have its display times shifted.
        # Uncomment the following to shift time to 9 a.m (32400 seconds)
        #shift_rain = True
        #
        # If you want another time span, then calculate and replace the number
        # of seconds with your own variant in the following tag, rain_start and
        # uncomment it. Then adjust the displayed time in the start_label tag
        # to suit that change (it's default is 9). The following example shows
        # a 7 a.m. start which evaluates as (3600 * 7) = 25200, so...
        #rain_start = 25200 # number of seconds in 7 hours
        #start_label = 7    # hours to display in the table heading

        [[DeltaT]]

        # delta-T calculations and data:
        #
        # What is delta-T? ... http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/deltat.shtml
        # It's assumed that most users won't want the delta-T calculations and
        # associated display so it's turned off by default.
        # This is a switch (boolean) to turn it on
        # If you decide you do want it generated then turn it on by uncommenting
        # the following entry
        #calculate_deltaT = True

        # If you turn delta-T on, then the following section also applies...
        #
        #delta-T configuration:
        #
        # An information message will appear on the report page (index.php) if
        # the database is in US units (imperial) or the units that are returned
        # don't match the native units required for the delta-T calcs
        # An information div is included in the report page when this occurs.
        #
        # The delta-T calcs will be adjusted for the most of the incoming units
        # but there may be further work required if the script doesn't detect
        # your incoming unit type. We need to make sure that the Units are
        # being detected correctly (no matter what they are, or what you wish
        # to be displayed in the report)
        # Configure them by using the [Units] [[Groups]] section below this.
        #
        # This is a switch (boolean) to turn it off

        # to show.

        [[PHPUnits]]

        # Conversions for database units to displayed units
        # these constants are used as function names in the php script.
        # If you need a unit that's different to that stored in the database,
        # this is where the conversion will be performed. Not every type is
        # listed, just the most common or likely based on the units of weewxs
        # .engine
        # Uncomment them if you need a conversion...
        # Only for the one/s you need.
        # Only from the group/s you need.
        # If you don't need a conversion performed then do nothing, leave them
        # all commented out.
        #
        # To find what your database units are reporting as, check the displayed
        # values with then all commented out (default installation of skin.conf)
        # and from the report page determine what is being displayed there.
        # eg:- degrees C or F
        # The difference with temperatures will be obvious, the others should
        # also make sense
        # Read them from left to right:
        # eg:- CtoF, from database to display, database is in C conversion will
        # be to F  etc...
